# GPU-Temperature-Check
A GPU temperature check using powershell and Nvidia.

# Which one should I use?
If you have an NVIDIA GPU and Drivers then use the NVIDIA-SMI file by downloading it, right-clicking it and clicking run with powershell.

For AMD or other GPUs use OpenHardwareMonitor (tutorial is inside the file)

For anyone else thats different and wants to use Powershell and WMIC to check, check inside the file.
